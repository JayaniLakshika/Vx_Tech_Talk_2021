## Main objective

- **.red[To develop an automatic algorithm to classify medicinal plants by using statistical machine learning approach]**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}

```

# Limitations

**Why medicinal plant leaves?**

--
- Leaf images are considered as they contain large number of diverse set of features such as **.orange[shape, veins, edge features, apices, etc]**. 

<img src="simple_leaf_parts.png" style="width: 40%" /><img src="full.png" style="width: 40%" />

--
- We used **.red[non-diseased leaves with simple arrangement]**.

--
- We used the leaves **.red[without a petiole.]** 

---
# Significance of the study

- **.red[To avoid misidentifying medicinal plants in Sri Lanka]**

- The algorithm developed by us is based on the leaf images. Since leaves are **.red[relatively easy to obtain without damaging the plants]**, there is no harm for the plants because of the development of algorithm. 

- Our algorithm works as a hierarchical classification system. Therefore even though we don't know the exact species name, we can follow the first 2 levels. As the result of that **.red[misidentification rate and computation time will be decreased]**.

# Image processing

- The image processing receives an image as input and generates a **.green[modified image]** as an output which is suitable for better **.orange[morphological analysis, feature extraction]**. 

- Image processing is an essential step to **.red[reduce noise, background subtraction and content enhancement]** in the identification process.

# Why feature extraction is important?

- Recently, many researchers use deep learning methods like CNN (Convolution Neural Network) to classify plants - directly using plant images. 

- Even though deep learning models have achieved great success, their interpretability, and transparency of the deep learning models are limited.

# Features

- In identification of plant species by using leaf images, **.green[features of the leaves play a main role]**.

--

- In previous research, let the algorithm like **.red[CNN]** to extract features by itself and do the classification. 

--

- Therefore it is so **.purple[hard to interpret and generalize]** the features. 

--

- We introduced **.red[pre-calculate features]** which can be **.green[easy to interpret and generalize]**. They are also **.green[computational efficient]**. 

--
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}

- We identified altogether **.orange[52 features]**.

## Visualization of Leaf Images in the Feature Space
Example: Flavia

- LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique, and PCA is unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique

- The first **.green[three principal components (PCs)]** accounting for approximately **.red[83%]** of the total variance in the original data

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("ldaflavia.png")
```

- Under both experimental settings class separation is **.orange[more clearly on the LDA space than the PCA space]**. The reason could be LDA is a supervised learning algorithm while PCA space is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

# Algorithm Development
![](leafim.png)


---


- Our medicinal plant classification algorithm contains **.green[two process: Training process and Test process]**.

- Our classification algorithm operates on the **.purple[features extracted from the image leaves]**. 

- The training process e of the algorithm contains four main steps: **.orange[i) Image processing, ii) Feature extraction, iii) Label images, and iv) Trained a algorithm]**.

- In the test process, image processing and feature extraction steps are followed by the **.orange[new image before feed to the pre-trained model]**. 

- Mainly **.red[Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting]** classification algorithms are used in our research.

# Discussion & Conclusions

# Hierarchical Approach

- Our algorithm works as a **.red[hierarchical classification system]**. The hierarchy contains **.purple[3 levels]**. The first level classifies images according to the **.red[shape]**. The second level classifies according to the **.red[edge types]**. The bottom level classifies the **.red[plant species]**.

- **.red[Scagnostic features]** like (i) Monotonic contour, (ii) Convex polar, (iii) Convex contour, (iv) Striated polar, (v) Striated contour, (vii) Skinny contour, and (vii) Skinny contour are more important in identifying leaf species in the **.red[bottom level]** of the hierarchy.

--
- We observe that **.red[shape feature is not sufficient]** to classify leaf images.

# Robust scaling

- If there are input variables that have very large values relative to the other input variables, these large values can dominate or skew some machine learning algorithms (eg: ANN, KNN, SVM etc).

- The result is that algorithm pay more attention to the large values and ignore the variables with smaller values.

## Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)

- Imbalance dataset is a classification problem where the class distribution is biased or skewed or not uniform. Most machine learning algorithms for classification are designed under the assumption that each class has an equal number of observations. That results, especially for the minority class in the model, has poor predictive performance. Even though minority class is more important, classification errors for minority class is more sensitive than majority class.

- One remedy for class imbalance is to use an over-sampling method. SMOTE is an over-sampling method which creates synthetic (not duplicates) samples for the minority class and makes the minority class equal to the majority class. By selecting similar records and altering that record one column at a time by random amount within the difference to the neighbouring records, SMOTE handles the imbalance problem.

# Key Insights
![](leafim.png)

---



- Most of the research are based on existing databases. Even though researchers used their own database most of the time they didn't define image acquisition process in detail or it was complex. Therefore through this research, we introduced simplest and reliable approach of acquiring leaf images which can be followed without expertise knowledge. 

--

- To classify leaf images, several reliable automatic procedures are used. But we introduced a hierarchical approach which perform better than non hierarchical approaches. 

--
- Random Forest in hierarchical approach

--
- We have to use training/test from same dataset to get accurate results.

# Further Research

- Develop algorithms to identify plant disease in Sri Lanka

--
- Expand the species collection

--
- Explore differences in plant features according to spatial distributions and climate conditions (For example, Gotukola leaf in Colombo is smaller than in Anuradhapura)

--
- Develop an algorithm to handle images with heterogeneous backgrounds
